With additional funding from ArcelorMittal Dofasco‚Äôs Corporate Community Fund, Green Cities Foundation, Rain Haven, and Tree Canada, we transformed over 2000 sq feet of lawn, pavement, and concrete into an urban green space filled with 500+ native species and trees. This guided rain garden tour and plant walk will allow you to explore the new rain gardens at Laidlaw Memorial United Church and learn about the design and plant selection from the Landscape Architect, Adele Pierre. Bring any gardening and plant design questions you have and we‚Äôll be happy to answer!",

The Green Infrastructure elements on site, like the rain gardens and the holding tank with pump and soaker hoses, are an excellent demonstration of water management and efficiency in an urban setting! üåßÔ∏èüí¶ The holding tank catches and retains stormwater to distribute through the pump and soaker hoses. Then, these hoses encourage healthier plant growth and water absorption by distributing the water at the root level, generating healthier plants designed and arranged to help hold excess amounts of water year-round!
